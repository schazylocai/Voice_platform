      "- Automating and tracking learner's progress: AI has the potential to automate and help track the learner's progress in various skills, identifying where a human teacher's assistance is needed.\n",
      "- Identifying effective teaching methods: AI can be used to help identify the most effective teaching methods based on students' contexts and learning background.\n",
      "- Automating operational tasks: AI can automate monotonous operational tasks, generate assessments, and automate grading and feedback.\n",
      "- Recommending personalized learning experiences: AI can recommend personalized learning experiences to students based on their contexts and learning backgrounds.\n",
      "- Enhancing assessments: AI can enhance our understanding of learners, not only in terms of what they know but also how they learn and which pedagogies work for them.\n",
      "- Providing intelligent tutoring systems: AI can provide intelligent learning environments that can interact with students, provide customized feedback, and enhance their understanding of certain topics.\n",
      "\n",
      "These use cases aim to reduce teachers' workload, provide contextualized learning for students, revolutionize assessments, and provide intelligent tutoring systems. However, it is important to note that teachers play a crucial role in how AI is used by learners, and teacher training is vital to fully understand the strengths and weaknesses of AI products. \n",

      "- \"It can automate monotonous operational tasks, generate assessments and automate grading and feedback.\"\n",
      "- \"AI does not only impact what students learn through recommendations, but also how they learn, what are the learning gaps, which pedagogies are more effective and how to retain learner's attention.\"\n",
      "- \"The purpose of AI in Education is to reduce teachers' workload without impacting learning outcomes.\"\n",
      "- \"The purpose of AI in Education is to provide customized and/or personalized learning experiences to students based on their contexts and learning backgrounds.\"\n",
      "- \"The purpose of AI in Education is to enhance our understanding of learners. This not only includes what they know, but also how they learn and which pedagogies work for them.\"\n",

      "References from the document:\n",
      "- Cutting edge AI by researchers and companies around the world is not of much use if it is not helping the primary grade student in learning.\n",
      "- With the recent developments in AI, particularly reinforcement learning techniques, the future holds exciting possibilities of where AI will take education.\n",
      "- Companies like Pearson and Century Tech are building great technology that is impacting learners across the globe.\n",
      "- For impactful AI in education, learners and teachers always need to be at the epicenter of AI development.\n",
